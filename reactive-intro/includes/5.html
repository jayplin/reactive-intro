  <h4>
    <strong>
      Reactive programming is programming with asynchronous data streams that
      can be created, changed or combined on the go.</strong
    >
    The trick is that we are not working with arrays now but streams.

    ## One does not simply explain a new concept without a car analogy
    ---
    ## []

    - arrays are the parking lots that can permanently store cars
    - when we check the parking lot, we can see all the cars that are presented there
    - When we log each then we can log each car <strong>currently</strong>  staying in the parking log.
    
    ---
    ## streams
    - streams are the streets where cars are present but just passing by, they are not <strong>really stored there </strong> 
    - when we look to the street we only see the car just passing by
    - the logging in this case is a continuous observation that happens once the stream is defined
    ---
    ## operators
    - filtering
      - if the driver is a wanted criminal then the police might stop him, and the car basically gets filtered from the stream
    - mapping
      - a car wash could be an operator, where the car gets cleaned during the process

            new values gets added to the original stream, but as the new stream
